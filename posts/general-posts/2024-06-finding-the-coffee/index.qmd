# Finding all The Coffee shops in Brazil

In this post, I'll show you how to map every The Coffee shop in Brazil in less time than it takes to brew a pot of coffee. All this from your laptop and without spending a dime.

We'll use only R and a few packages to webscrape all addresses

### What is The Coffee

The Coffee is a Japanese-inspired chain of coffee shops with a distinct minimalist visual identity. Their street shops are small, clean, and extremely space-efficient, sometimes taking less than 20 m2. They offer a wide variety of high quality coffee at a premium price point.

Similar to Starbucks, product customization is a major selling point. Customers can choose and replace pretty much everything in their drinks, from adding and additional espresso shot, requiring an additional pump of chocolate syrup. Unlike Starbucks, however, most The Coffee shops are strictly to-go, or offer only minimal seating capacity. The Coffee doesn't aim at becoming a 3rd place, where friends meet to share a cup of coffee, or work colleagues schedule a meeting.

The Coffee also strays away from the traditional friendly-neighborhood barista and instead focuses on a more technological approach. Customers mainly interact with a tablet that displays the menu and all customization choices. Friendly chatter is an optional, as a customer can get in, get his coffee without exchaning any words with the barista.

The company was founded in Curitiba, at the southern part of Brazil, in 2018, and has expanded rapidly to 12 countries with over 200 shops. Their franchise model in part explains this strong expansion.

Spatial analysis allows us to examine geographical patterns, relationships, and trends, providing valuable insights for businesses, urban planning, and research. Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates

Geocoding is a pivotal process in spatial analysis, converting textual location descriptions, such as addresses or place names, into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). At its core, geocoding translates a human-readable address (e.g., "Rua dos Bobos, 0, São Paulo, Brazil") into a precise point on a map. This process involves matching the input address with geographic data, usually from a reference database like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap, and outputting the corresponding coordinates.

These coordinates are essential for placing locations on a map and performing further spatial analysis. Understanding the importance of geocoding helps frame the rest of the analysis and clarifies why it's a necessary first step.

### Patterns in Coffee Shop Locations

The distribution of coffee shops across Brazil is influenced by various factors, including population density, tourism, and regional economic activity. Major cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are expected to have a high concentration of coffee shops, catering to both locals and tourists.

Coffee is deeply intertwined with Brazilian culture and economy. Brazil is not only the world's largest coffee producer but also has a vibrant coffee culture that spans from traditional cafes to modern specialty coffee shops. Coffee can be found ubiquitously from R\$1 to R\$20

### Strategic Insights for Businesses

For coffee shop owners and entrepreneurs, understanding the spatial distribution of competitors is crucial for making informed decisions about where to open new locations. A map showing the density of coffee shops can highlight saturated markets where competition is fierce, as well as underserved areas that might represent untapped opportunities. Additionally, proximity to other amenities, such as universities, shopping centers, or public transportation, can influence the success of a coffee shop, making spatial analysis an essential tool for strategic planning.

1.  Population density.
2.  Average income.
3.  Age demographics.
4.  Proximity to points of interest (POI), e.g. universities, shopping centers, public transportation, etc.

### Why use R?

The R language offers numerous advantages:

1.  It's free and has a rich and diverse collection of packages, tutorials, and reusable code.
2.  

We'll leverage the power of R, an open-source programming language that's widely used in data science. Using R offers numerous advantages: it’s free, the code can be reused and adapted to various contexts, and its strong emphasis on reproducibility ensures that your analyses can be replicated by others. We'll use the tidyverse, a collection of R packages designed for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis, to make the process efficient and straightforward.

In this tutorial, we'll dive into spatial analysis using R, focusing on geocoding all coffee shops in Brazil.
