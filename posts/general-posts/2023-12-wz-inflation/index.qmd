# Brazil's Inflation

Brazil has a long and painful story with inflation. Though technically Brazilian inflation only classified as a hyperinflation during a brief period in the early 1990s[^1], few countries had to endure such a long-standing period of prolonged and relentless inflation. The chart below shows the monthly percentage change in Brazil's official consumer price index IPCA. I highlight some important economic and institutional events. Chiefs of the executive are also shaded in through different colors. It's important to note that Figueiredo was not a constitutionally elected president, but rather the last leader of the Military Regime.

This visualization is heavily inspired by the graphic from the book [Saga Brasileira: a longa luta de um povo por sua moeda](https://www.amazon.com.br/Saga-brasileira-longa-luta-moeda/dp/8501088714)[^2], by Miriam Leitão. Total inflation during the "hyperinflation" period surpassed 13 trillion percent! In July of 1994 the ingeniously designed Plano Real stabilizes Brazil's economy and ends a long period of persistently high inflation. The Brazil post-Plano Real represents a paradigm shift, yet it is not entirely immune to inflation. In the nearly 30 years since the implementation of Plano Real, Brazil has witnessed a cumulative inflation of 560%.

[^2]: Loosely translated: "The Brazilian Saga: the long struggle of a people for its currency".

A nuance that is not captured by the graphic is the frequency of currency changes during this era[^3]. Nearly every new economic plan brought about either a change in currency or a price/wage freeze. The dips in the plot coincide with theses moments, marking brief lapses of time when inflation seemed to magically subside, only to return with renewed vigor.

[^3]: Before 1986, Brazil's currency was the Cruzeiro, though it had been "updated" several times to accommodate inflation. After the Cruzado Plan, the official currency became the "Cruzado". In 1989, it transitioned to the "Cruzado Novo" (New Cruzado), following the Verão Plan. With the Collor Plan, in 1990, came a new currency that borrowed the old "Cruzeiro" name. Ultimately, in the lead-up to the Real, Brazil introduced a "virtual currency" named URV and the Cruzeiro was renamed as "Cruzeiro Real".
