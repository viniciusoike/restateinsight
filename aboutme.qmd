# Sobre - PT

## Sobre o Site

Neste site você vai encontrar vários posts sobre economia, mercado, visualização e análise de dados. Também escrevo vários tutoriais sobre `R`, a linguagem de programação que tenho maior proficiência. A maior parte dos posts e textos estão na aba `Blog`. Tenho alguns aplicativos, desenvolvidos com [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co), na aba `Apps`.

Este site foi originalmente lançado no final de 2019, usando `RMarkdown` e o pacote `blogdown`. A versão atual foi lançada oficialmente em 2023, usando [Quarto](https://quarto.org) uma linguagem integrada para apresentação de análises de dados, que junta R, Python, Julia e diversas outras linguagens de programação.

## Sobre Mim

Meu nome é Vinicius Oike Reginatto, sou mestre em Economia pela Universidade de São Paulo. No meu mestrado, estudei sobre teorias de crescimento econômico e escrevi sobre a história da matematização da teoria econômica.

Trabalho como consultor econômico desde 2019. Tenho experiência com projetos de infraestrutura urbana (TOD) e análise de mercado e de conjuntura econômica. Tenho um forte background quantitativo e expertise em análise de dados (R/Python).

On this website, you'll find various posts about economics, data visualization, and data analysis. I also write several tutorials about `R`, the programming language in which I'm most proficient. Most of the posts and texts are under the [`Blog`](https://restateinsight.com/blog) tab. I have some applications, developed with Shiny, under the [`Apps`](https://restateinsight.com/my_apps) tab.

This site was originally launched in late 2019, using `RMarkdown` and the `blogdown` package. The current version was officially released in 2023, using [Quarto](https://quarto.org), an integrated language for presenting data analyses, which combines R, Python, Julia, and several other programming languages.
