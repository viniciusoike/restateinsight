## Presentation

My name is Vinícius Reginatto. I hold a degree in Economics from [UFRGS](http://www.ufrgs.br/english/home), recognized as Brazil's leading university by INEP, and a **Master’s degree in Economics** from the [University of São Paulo (USP)](https://www.fea.usp.br/en), consistently ranked as the top university in Latin America.

With a strong quantitative foundation, I focus on areas such as **spatial analysis, econometrics, and time-series forcasting**. I am proficient in Python, R, Quarto, Shiny, SQL, and a range of widely used machine learning algorithms. Additionally, I have developed [R packages](https://github.com/viniciusoike/realestatebr) and [Shiny applications](https://restateinsight.com/my_apps) to address specific analytical challenges. My professional experience spans data science and economic consulting.

Over the years, I have worked on economic consulting projects, focused on urban intervention initiatives—such as transit-oriented development (TOD)—and real estate market analysis. In these roles, I collaborated remotely with large, multidisciplinary, and multilingual teams to deliver impactful results.
