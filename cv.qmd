### Presentation

My name is Vinícius Reginatto, and I hold a degree in Economics from [UFRGS](http://www.ufrgs.br/english/home), recognized as the top university in Brazil by INEP, as well as a Master's degree in Economics from the [University of São Paulo](https://www.fea.usp.br/en) (USP), consistently ranked as the best university in Latin America.

I have a strong quantitative background, that includes mathematical optimization, time series forecasting, spatial analysis, econometrics and statistics. I am proficient in Python, R, Quarto, Shiny, SQL, and the most popular machine learning algorithms. I’ve also developed [packages in R](https://github.com/viniciusoike/realestatebr) and [applications in Shiny](https://restateinsight.com/my_apps). My professional background encompasses both data science and economic consulting.

Throughout the years I’ve worked in several economic consulting projects, mostly focused on urban intervention projects (e.g., transit-oriented development) and real estate analysis. At these jobs, I worked remotely in large multidisciplinary and multilingual teams.
