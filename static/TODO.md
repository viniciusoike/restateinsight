## Low Priority - Minimal Content (Need major work)

### Brazil in Charts Series (4 posts)
All posts only have titles, need full content:

1. **Demographics 1** - `posts/brazil-in-charts/demographics-1.qmd`
2. **Demographics 2** - `posts/brazil-in-charts/demographics-2.qmd`
3. **House Prices** - `posts/brazil-in-charts/house-prices.qmd`
4. **Transport/Accessibility** - `posts/brazil-in-charts/transport.qmd`

**Suggestion:** Create a cohesive series about Brazilian statistics. Consider creating a template structure and batch-completing them.

### Tutorial ggplot2 Series (3 posts)

1. **12-4-mapas** - `posts/tutorial-ggplot2/12-4-mapas.qmd`
2. **14-plot-machine** - `posts/tutorial-ggplot2/14-plot-machine.qmd`

## Recommendations

1. **Quick Wins:** Focus on posts 1-3 first - they're nearly complete and could be published within 1-2 weeks
2. **Theme Weeks:** Group thematic posts together and complete them as batches
3. **Archive Decision:** Review posts from 2023 - consider if they're still relevant or should be deleted
4. **Template Creation:** For the brazil-in-charts series, create a standard template to speed up completion
5. **Series Completion:** Prioritize finishing tutorial series (ggplot2, tidyverse) as they provide ongoing value
